	----------------------------------------------------
	-Startup of the backend, API, and frontend services- 
	----------------------------------------------------
	
	
Summary: 
--------The script manages the startup of the backend and API, ensuring that any existing processes are terminated before starting new ones.
	It also includes checks to confirm that each service is running successfully.

1)
Network Check: 
	- check if the NetworkManager is active. If not, display a message and exit.
2)
Start Backend:
	- change dir to: ./backend
	- kill any existing process running api.py to ensure no conflicts.
	- start the backend using uvicorn, specifying the host and port, and logs the output to backend_startup.log.
	- checks if backend is running by looking for the api.py process.
3)
Start API:
	- It sends a health check request to the API at http://localhost:3000/health. If API is not responding, show error message and exit.

4)
Start Frontend:
	- change dir to: ../trading-bot-frontend
	- kill any existing process using port 3001 and stop any running frontend process.
	- It checks again if port 3001 is occupied and prompts for a different port if necessary.
	- starts the frontend using npm start and logs any errors.
	- It waits for 5 seconds to allow the frontend to start and checks if it is running.
	- Open Chrome: If it is not running, start it
5)
Final Message: 
	- display success message once all services have restarted.
